Plugins
=======

.. index::
   single: plugins

Plugins are a comfortable way of extending Slash's behavior. They are objects inheriting from a :class:`common base class <.PluginInterface>` that can be activated to modify or what happens in select point of the infrastructure. 

The Plugin Interface
--------------------

Plugins have several special methods that can be overriden, like :func:`get_name <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.get_name>` or :func:`configure_argument_parser <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.configure_argument_parser>`. Except for these methods and the ones documented, each public method (i.e. a method not beginning with an underscore) must correspond to a :ref:`slash hook <hooks>` by name. 

The name of the plugin should be returned by :func:`get_name <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.get_name>`. This name should be unique, and not shared by any other plugin.

Plugin Discovery
----------------

Plugins can be loaded from multiple locations. 

Search Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, the paths in ``plugins.search_paths`` are searched for python files. For each file, a function called ``install_plugins`` is called (assuming it exists), and this gives the file a chance to install its plugins.


Plugin Installation
-------------------

To install a plugin, use the :func:`slash.plugins.manager.install <slash.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager.install>` function, and pass it the plugin class that is being installed. Note that installed plugins are not active by default, and need to be explicitly activated (see below).

Only plugins that are :class:`.PluginInterface` derivative instances are accepted.

To uninstall plugins, you can use the :func:`slash.plugins.manager.uninstall <slash.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager.uninstall>`. 

.. note:: uninstalling plugins also deactivates them.


Internal Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: plugins; internal

By default, plugins are considered "external", meaning they were
loaded by the user (either directly or indirectly). External plugins
can be activated and deactivated through the command-line using
``--with-<plugin name>`` and ``--without-<plugin name>``.

In some cases, though, you may want to install a plugin in a way that
would not let the user disable it externally. Such plugins are
considered "internal", and cannot be deactivated through the command
line. 

You can install a plugin as an internal plugin by passing ``internal=True`` to the install function.

Plugin Activation
-----------------

Plugins are activated via :func:`slash.plugins.manager.activate <slash.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager.activate>` and deactivated via :func:`slash.plugins.manager.deactivate <slash.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager.deactivate>`.

During the activation all hook methods get registered to their respective hooks, so any plugin containing an unknown hook will trigger an exception.

.. note:: by default, all method names in a plugin are assumed to belong to the *slash* gossip group. This means that the method ``session_start`` will register on ``slash.session_start``. You can override this behavior by using :func:`slash.plugins.registers_on`:
  
  .. code-block:: python

     from slash.plugins import registers_on
     
     class MyPlugin(PluginInterface):
         @registers_on('some_hook')
         def func(self):
             ...


``registers_on(None)`` has a special meaning - letting Slash know that this is not a hook entry point, but a private method belonging to the plugin class itself.

.. seealso:: :ref:`hooks`


Activating plugins from command-line is usually done with the ``--with-`` prefix. For example, to activate a plugin called ``test-plugin``, you can pass ``--with-test-plugin`` when running ``slash run``. 

Also, since some plugins can be activated from other locations, you can also override and deactivate plugins using ``--without-X`` (e.g. ``--without-test-plugin``).

Conditionally Registering Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make the hook registration of a plugin *conditional*, meaning it should only happen if a boolean condition is ``True``.

This can be used to create plugins that are compatible with multiple versions of Slash:

.. code-block:: python
       
       class MyPlugin(PluginInterface):
           ...
           @slash.plugins.register_if(int(slash.__version__.split('.')[0]) >= 1)
           def shiny_new_hook(self):
	       ...

.. seealso:: :func:`slash.plugins.register_if`

Plugin Command-Line Interaction
-------------------------------

In many cases you would like to receive options from the command line. Plugins can implement the :func:`configure_argument_parser <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.configure_argument_parser>` and the :func:`configure_parsed_args <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.configure_from_parsed_args>` functions:

.. code-block:: python

 class ResultsReportingPlugin(PluginInterface):
 
     def configure_argument_parser(self, parser):
         parser.add_argument("--output-filename", help="File to write results to")
 
     def configure_from_parsed_args(self, args):
         self.output_filename = args.output_filename

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

Plugins can override the :func:`config <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.get_default_config>` method to provide configuration to be placed under ``plugin_config.<plugin name>``:

.. code-block:: python

 class LogCollectionPlugin(PluginInterface):

     def get_default_config(self):
         return {
             'log_destination': '/some/default/path'
         }

The configuration is then accessible with :func:`get_current_config <slash.plugins.PluginInterface.current_config>` property.

Plugin Examples
---------------

An example of a functioning plugin can be found in the :ref:`customizing` section.

Errors in Plugins
-----------------

As more logic is added into plugins it becomes more likely for exceptions to occur when running their logic. As seen above, most of what plugins do is done by registering callbacks onto hooks. Any exception that escapes these registered functions will be handled the same way any exception in a hook function is handled, and this depends on the current exception swallowing configuration.

.. seealso:: 

   * :ref:`exception swallowing <exception_swallowing>`
   * :ref:`hooks documentation <hooks>`


Plugin Dependencies
-------------------

Slash supports defining dependencies between plugins, in a mechanism closely related to to `gossip's hook dependencies <http://gossip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hook_dependencies.html>`_. The purpose of these dependencies is to make sure a certain hook registration in a specific plugin (or all such hooks for that matter) is called before or after equivalent hooks on other plugins.

Notable examples of why you might want this include, among many other cases:

* Plugins reporting test status needing a state computed by other plugins
* Error handling plugins wanting to be called first in certain events
* Log collection plugins wanting to be called only after all interesting code paths are logged


Defining Plugin Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defining dependencies is done primarily with two decorators Slash
provides: ``@slash.plugins.needs`` and
``@slash.plugins.provides``. Both of these decorators use string
identifiers to denote the dependencies used. These identifiers are
arbitrary, and can be basically any string, as long as it matches
between the dependent plugin and the providing plugin.

Several use cases exist:

Hook-Level Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Adding the ``slash.plugins.needs`` or ``slash.plugins.provides``
decorator to a specific hook method on a plugin indicates that we
would like to depend on or be the dependency accordingly. For example:

.. code-block:: python
       
       class TestIdentificationPlugin(PluginInterface):

           @slash.plugins.provides('awesome_test_id')
           def test_start(self):
	       slash.context.test.awesome_test_id = awesome_id_allocation_service()

       class TestIdentificationLoggingPlugin(PluginInterface):

           @slash.plugins.needs('awesome_test_id')
           def test_start(self):
	       slash.logger.debug('Test has started with the awesome id of {!r}', slash.context.test.awesome_id)

In the above example, the ``test_start`` hook on
``TestIdentificationLoggingPlugin`` needs the ``test_start`` of
``TestIdentificationPlugin`` to be called first, and thus **requires**
the ``'awesome_test_id'`` identifier which is provided by the latter.


Plugin-Level Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Much like hook-level dependencies, you can decorate the entire plugin
with the ``needs`` and ``provides`` decorators, creating a dependency
on all hooks provided by the plugin:

.. code-block:: python
       
       @slash.plugins.provides('awesome_test_id')
       class TestIdentificationPlugin(PluginInterface):

           def test_start(self):
	       slash.context.test.awesome_test_id = awesome_id_allocation_service()

       @slash.plugins.needs('awesome_test_id')
       class TestIdentificationLoggingPlugin(PluginInterface):

           def test_start(self):
	       slash.logger.debug('Test has started with the awesome id of {!r}', slash.context.test.awesome_id)

The above example is equivalent to the previous one, only now future
hooks added to either of the plugins will automatically assume the
same dependency specifications.

.. note:: You can use ``provides`` and ``needs`` in more complex
          cases, for example specifying ``needs`` on a specific hook
          in one plugin, where the entire other plugin is decorated
          with ``provides`` (at plugin-level). 

.. note:: Plugin-level provides and needs also get transferred upon
          inheritence, automatically adding the dependency
          configuration to derived classes.


Plugin Manager
--------------

As mentioned above, the Plugin Manager provides API to activate (or deacativate) and install (or uninstall) plugins.
Additionally, it provides access to instances of registered plugins by their name via :func:`slash.plugins.manager.get_plugin <slash.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager.get_plugin>`.
This could be used to access plugin attributes whose modification (e.g. by fixtures) can alter the plugin's behavior.

Plugins and Parallel Runs
-------------------------

.. index::
   double: parallel; plugins

Not all plugins can support :ref:`parallel execution <parallel>`, and for others implementing
support for it can be much harder than supporting non-parallel runs alone.

To deal with this, in addition to possible mistakes or corruption caused by plugins incorrectly used
in parallel mode, Slash requires each plugin to indicate whether or not it supports parallel
execution. The assumption is that by default plugins do not support parallel runs at all.

To indicate that your plugin supports parallel execution, use the  :func:`plugins.parallel_mode
<slash.plugins.parallel_mode>` marker:

.. code-block:: python

                from slash.plugins import PluginInterface, parallel_mode

                @parallel_mode('enabled')
                class MyPlugin(PluginInterface):
                    ...

``parallel_mode`` supports the following modes:

* ``disabled`` - meaning the plugin does not support parallel execution at all. This is the default.
* ``parent-only`` - meaning the plugin supports parallel execution, but should be active only on the
  parent process.
* ``child-only`` - meaning the plugin should only be activated on worker/child processes executing
  the actual tests.
* ``enabled`` - meaning the plugin supports parallel execution, both on parent and child.
