The Slash Testing Framework
===========================

What is Slash?
--------------

Slash is a testing framework written in Python. Unlike many other testing frameworks out there, Slash focuses on building in-house testing solutions for large projects. It provides facilities and best practices for testing complete products, and not only unit tests for individual modules.

Slash provides several key features:

* A solid execution model based on fixtures, test factories and tests. This provides you with the flexibility you need to express your testing logic.
* Easy ways for extending the core functionality, adding more to the global execution environment and controlling how your tests interact with it.
* A rich configuration mechanism, helping you setting up your environment parameters and their various flavours.
* A plugin architecture, greatly simplifying adding extra functionality to your framework.
